Step 1: from SMILES  2021.10.13+1.g1177adb
    Create the structure from the SMILES 'CCS', overwriting the current
    configuration. The name of the system will be the canonical SMILES of the
    structure. The name of the configuration will be initial.

    Created a molecular structure with 9 atoms.
           System name = CCS
    Configuration name = initial
